## Biography

I am Haichuan Liu, an undergraduate in **Microelectronics Science and Engineering** at Peking University's School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science.

My work centers on the intersection of semiconductor technology, electronic design automation (EDA), and high-performance computing. I am driven by the challenge of applying computational intelligence to solve fundamental problems in modern integrated circuit design. My primary research interests include:

*   **AI for EDA:** Applying machine learning to optimize critical chip design stages, including placement, routing, and timing prediction.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Harnessing parallel computing architectures like GPUs (CUDA) and FPGAs to achieve significant speedups for complex EDA algorithms.
*   **VLSI Timing Analysis:** Focusing on Static Timing Analysis (STA) and developing advanced methodologies for achieving timing closure in high-performance digital circuits.

I am always excited to discuss these topics and explore potential collaborations. Please feel free to connect with me.
