## Biography

I am Haichuan Liu, an undergraduate in **Microelectronics Science and Engineering** at Peking University's School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Yibo Lin](https://yibolin.com/).

My work centers on the intersection of semiconductor technology, electronic design automation (EDA), and high-performance computing. My primary research interests include:

*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Harnessing parallel computing architectures like GPUs (CUDA) and FPGAs to achieve significant speedups for complex EDA algorithms.
*   **VLSI Timing Analysis:** Focusing on Static TIming Analysis (STA) and developing advanced methodologies for achieving timing closure in advanced-node designs.

<!-- I am always excited to discuss these topics and seek mutual improvement. -->
My Chinese name is 刘海川.
