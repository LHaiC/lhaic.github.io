## Biography

I am Haichuan Liu, an undergraduate student majoring in **Microelectronics Science and Engineering** at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University.

My passion lies at the intersection of semiconductor technology, electronic design automation (EDA), and high-performance computing. I am particularly interested in applying computational intelligence to solve fundamental challenges in integrated circuit design. My primary research interests include:

*   **AI for EDA:** Applying machine learning to optimize chip design processes like placement, routing, and timing prediction.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Leveraging NVIDIA CUDA for high-performance parallel computing to accelerate complex EDA algorithms.
*   **VLSI Timing Analysis:** Focusing on Static Timing Analysis (STA) and methodologies for achieving timing closure in modern digital circuits.

Please feel free to get in touch with me.
