I am pleased to share that Shenglu Hua and I have won the Second Place in the EDAthon 2025 Contest, advised by Prof. Yibo Lin.

Organized by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), EDAthon is a whole-day programming contest featuring interesting and challenging topics in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). This year's event was generously sponsored by Cadence, UniVista, HiSilicon, and the IEEE CEDA family (Global, HK, and GZ Chapters).

Sincere gratitude to our advisor, the organizers, and everyone who supported us!
